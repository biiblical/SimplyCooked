                <ol class="instructions">
                    <!-- Preparation steps -->
                    <h4>Step 1</h4>
                    <li>Place the pork chops between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound them until just 1/4 inch 
                        thick with the flat side of a meat tenderizer. Lightly season both sides with salt and freshly 
                        ground black pepper.</li>
                    <h4>Step 2</h4>
                    <li>Place the flour mixture, egg, and breadcrumbs in 3 separate shallow bowls. Dip the chops in 
                        the flour, the egg, and the breadcrumbs, coating both sides and all edges at each stage. Be 
                        careful not to press the breadcrumbs into the meat. Gently shake off the excess crumbs. Don't 
                        let the schnitzel sit in the coating or they will not be as crispy once fried - fry immediately.
                    </li>
                    <h4>Step 3</h4>
                    <li>Make sure the cooking oil is hot enough at this point (about 330 degrees F) as you don't want 
                        the Schnitzel to sit around in the coating before frying. Use enough oil so that the Schnitzels 
                        "swim" in it.
                        Fry the Schnitzel for about 2-3 minutes on both sides until a deep golden brown. Transfer briefly 
                        to a plate lined with paper towels.</li>
                    <h4>Step 4</h4>
                    <li>Serve immediately with slices of fresh lemon and parsley sprigs or with your choice of sauce. Serve 
                        with German Spaetzle (see recipe for Homemade German Spaetzle), French fries, or German potato salad, 
                        and with a fresh leafy green salad</li>
